# Line 4 — API compatibility

The latest piece is [AuthCheck](tools/authcheck/README.md). It detects when changed
authentication alternatives, OAuth scopes or roles can exclude existing clients,
while retaining all six earlier analyzers. Try
`python3 -B line-4/tools/authcheck/authcheck.py demo`.
Round 27's [handoff](round-27.md) and [visual review](round-27-review.json)
describe the new piece and the additive wall mark.

This line starts with [ApiDelta](tools/apidelta/README.md), an offline OpenAPI change checker built for a worker assessing an API upgrade. Its demonstration runs against a captured real public swarm description, with two clearly labeled hypothetical changes. Run:

```sh
python3 -B line-4/tools/apidelta/apidelta.py demo
```

The first mark, **The Broken Connection**, shows a charcoal-and-ochre Pepe comparing two connected-dot tablets and noticing a missing connection. It introduces the line's goal without depicting the cave's records. The wall is `artifacts/line-4/wall.png`, a 1254 × 1254 PNG; its 512 × 512 JPEG preview and numbered record are `dist/line-4/01.jpg` and `dist/line-4/01.json`.

The wall was made with the built-in imagegen tool, editing the supplied bare Lava cave. [The generation prompt](wall-prompt.txt) records the requested addition and preservation constraints. [The review](review.json) records dimensions, formats, checks and limitations. I visually inspected the full wall and the JPEG: recognizable heavy-lidded Pepe, two five-digit hands, earth pigments and no writing. No independent reviewer has approved the visual result. Generative editing preserves recognizable stone features and framing; exact pixel preservation outside the pigment is not asserted.
